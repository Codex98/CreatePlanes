#if i was to make a game could i use this information to generate an image of a plane? say, if you filled out
#how many engines does your plane have?: 4
# then the computer should generate an image in the database. say i put an image of a fighter sillhouette, plus a 2 engine and a four engine, and then i finally type in the code.
#it should assign a plane to each answer. if i assign it in a 'fixed world'.
