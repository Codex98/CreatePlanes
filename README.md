Simple python input/output code

This definatley has room for improvement and growth, maybe some graphics down the road and links to more code inside a game.
Possibilities: 
1. Link the choices (input from user) to a database with graphics that will match the user's text input with an image of a real aircraft. 
2. Later, the computer can use this image in a simple-graphics game, with all the users specifications on it (paint, weapons, engines, etc) 
3. It will then use this information in the game, plus you can change these specs as you move along in the game and it's levels.

In short, this is really only a beginning. Once I really get into the language of python (programming in general, really) there *might* be some updates coming in the form of a primitive computer game. 
Stay tuned! :)
